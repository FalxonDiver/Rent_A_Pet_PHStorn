    <p> My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.</p>
    <p> I really wanted to have a small dog that I could take out for walks, but I though it was not possible.</p>
    <p> Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try.  I found a  loveable bassett hound and met her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.</p>
    <p> We went through a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time.  The great Rent A Pet staff came and picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about feeding or watering "Sophie".</p>
    <p> We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits.  I know I look forward to getting in my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.</p>
    <h3>Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week, Yours, Bessie Anderson.</h3>

    <p> I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys.</p>
    <p> I always wanted to have a large breed of dog that would be a companion to take running or play catch with in the park.  With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard.</p>
    <p> He loves to run in the summer and even cross country ski in the winter.  The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course.</p>
    <p> I always attract the attention of girls in the park when we go there.  I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away.</p>
    <p> One day I will have a home where I can have a yard to keep my own dog.  Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.</p>

    <p> My business requires me to travel quite a bit.  So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own.</p>
    <p> I would have to constantly find someone to pet sit, or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.  I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets.</p>
    <p> Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my lifestyle.  I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.</p>
    <p> I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep a house plant alive.  I can have fun with exotic pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy.</p>
    <p> Thanks for adding spice to my life.</p>

    <p> As a young girl, I developed a love of horses.  But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.</p>
    <p> I was delighted to find Rent A Pet.  They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels.</p>
    <p> They will deliver the horse to the trail where I want to ride.  Because I can request the same horse time after time, I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of the horse I ride.</p>
    <p> I would never be able to provide room and board for my own animal.</p>
    <h3>Thanks for making a dream come true, Melinda Morrison.</h3>
